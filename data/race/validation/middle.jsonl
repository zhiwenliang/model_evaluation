Smog is dirty air that looks like a mixture of smoke and fog, caused mainly by smoke from cars and factories in cities.\nAn official for the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Beijing News that PM2.5 pollution is the main problem with air pollution. PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter  .\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal.\nPoor air has done harm to people's health.

A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from January 5 to January 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory   problems.\nTo respond to the air problem, the Chinese government and many Chinese people have started to take action.\nBeijing announced a plan to use clean fuel in government vehicles and plant trees. It asked citizens to set off fewer fireworks for the Spring Festival celebration. They suggested that cars with large emissions   should be banned and factories should be closely watched.\nThree students from No. 4 High School in Beijing wrote a report to advise to fight the air pollution. \"We hope more people will join us to protect our environment.

The problem a creator faces is not running out of material; it is what to do with the material knocking at the door of imagination.\nStudy your role models, accept the gifts they have given, and leave behind what does not server. Then you can say, \"I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors\" tragedies and stories, and know that they are cheering on.", "answer": "A", "question": "What is the author's purpose in writing this passage?", "options": ["To highlight the importance of creatively.", "To criticize the characters of role models.", "To compare imitation with creation.", "To explain the meaning of success."]}

{"example_id": "middle6275.txt", "article": "Life is full of surprises and you never know how things will turn out .Sir John Gurdon is a good example of this. As a boy, he was told he was hopeless at science and finished bottom of his class. Now, aged 79, the very same Gurdon shared the 2012 Nobe Prize in Medicine with Japanese stem cell  researcher Shinya Yamanaka.\nLike so many scientists, Gurdon shows us where the power of curiosity and perseverance  can lead.\nAt the age of 15 in 1948, Gurdon ranked last out of the 250 boys at his high school in biology and every other science subject. Gurdon's high school science teacher even said that his dream of becoming a scientist was\"quite ridiculous\".\nIn spite of his teacher s criticisms,Gurdon followed his curiosity and kept working hard. He went to the lab early and left later than anyone else. He experienced thousands of failures.\n\"My own belief is that we will, in the end, understand everything about how cells actually work,\" Gurdon said.\nIn 1962, Gurdon took a cell from an adult frog and moved its genetic information into an egg cell.

A moon-shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles. They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering  up into the sky, where they believed Artemis lived.\nThe tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits. It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers  to the gods. Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten.\nTraditionally, one candle represents a year of the person's age. Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck. But that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday. Generally, older people's birthdays are celebrated by placing just a few candles to represent, such as an eight for 80th birthday.\nToday's birthday candles are made in different shapes, like animals or flowers.

They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering  up into the sky, where they believed Artemis lived.\nThe tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits. It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers  to the gods. Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten.\nTraditionally, one candle represents a year of the person's age. Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck. But that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday. Generally, older people's birthdays are celebrated by placing just a few candles to represent, such as an eight for 80th birthday.\nToday's birthday candles are made in different shapes, like animals or flowers. One or two candles in the shape of numbers are sometimes used instead of lots of candles; for example, a four-shaped and a zero-shaped candle would represent 40.", "answer": "B", "question": "What is the tradition of lighting candles for birthdays like in Europe?", "options": ["The candles were always kept burning all day on a person's birthday.", "The blowing out of candles represented one's prayers to the god.", "Some cultures believe it is right to blow out the candles before the evening meal.", "The Europeans sometimes keep burning the candles all day just as a celebration.

They give interesting information about each animal, such as where it comes from and how it lives. Special teachers at the zoo help children to understand more about the animals. Trained guides show visitors around the zoo.\nSecondly, zoos are working hard to find out more about animals. New knowledge leads to improved ways of looking after animals in the zoo, and better understanding of the same animals in the wild.\nThirdly, zoos play a part in protecting animals and stopping them from disappearing. Zoos work together with each other to help the animals in danger. For example, gorillas  from Taronga Zoo were sent to live with gorillas at the Melbourne Zoo in the hope that they would give birth to babies.\nFinally, zoos are important for people's enjoyment. People enjoy getting close to animals without having to cross the plains of Africa or climb the mountains of China. In the past, animal shows were common in zoos. Visitors were excited by monkeys in human clothes, and they even took rides on elephants or horses. However, today people prefer to see animals behaving naturally.\nSo a modern zoo is a place where animals are well cared for.", "answer": "D", "question": "Special teachers at the zoo  _  .", "options": ["show visitors around the zoo", "ride elephants or horses", "look after animals in danger", "help children know about animals"]}

{"example_id": "middle7890.txt", "article": "Are you happy most of the time? Or do you easily get angry sometimes? Everyone has a different temperament . It is usually believed that both genes  and environment may affect people's temperaments in different ways. Scientists have found that the season of the birth also plays a role.\nScientists from Budapest, Hungary, studied 400 university students. In the study, the students need to finish a questionnaire .

Suppose you hope to get a football for your birthday. A football is a want. You can live without it.\nSometimes we might want something so much that it feels like a need.

What would you give up if you went to the movie?", "answer": "A", "question": "The writer tells the differences between needs and wants by   _  .", "options": ["giving examples", "doing research", "making a survey", "having interviews"]}
